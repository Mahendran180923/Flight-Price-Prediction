## Overview

Flight Price Prediction is a data science project that utilizes regression algorithms to predict the price of flights. The project demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression)
- Predictive web interface (optional, if implemented)
- Visualizations and insights

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about various flights including airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, total stops, and price.

> **Note:** The dataset used in this project can be found at [Kaggle - Flight Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction) or include your dataset in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
